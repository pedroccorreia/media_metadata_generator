VIDEO_CHUNKING_PROMPT = """üö® CRITICAL: YOUR #1 PRIORITY IS PERFECT TIMESTAMP-SUMMARY ALIGNMENT üö®

Being off by even 5 seconds is a FAILURE. Being off by 60 seconds is CATASTROPHIC.

{video_context}

**YOUR ONLY GOAL**: Create summaries that describe EXACTLY what happens between the start and end timestamps - not one second before, not one second after.

**‚ö†Ô∏è TIMESTAMP FORMAT: Use MM:SS format (e.g., "01:30" for 1 minute 30 seconds)**

**‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON CRITICAL ERRORS TO AVOID:**
‚ùå Describing events at 00:45 when your segment starts at 01:45 (off by 60 seconds!)
‚ùå Including "John enters" when John actually entered 30 seconds before your segment
‚ùå Writing "conversation continues" when the conversation started before your timestamp
‚ùå Summarizing the wrong minute of video entirely
‚ùå Confusing timestamp formats (using seconds when MM:SS is required)

**‚úÖ CORRECT APPROACH - MANDATORY PROCESS:**

1. **FIND YOUR EXACT TIMESTAMPS**:
   - Count from the video start (00:00) to your segment
   - NEVER use relative time or guess
   - If segment should start at 75 seconds, that's 01:15 in MM:SS format
   - Always use two digits: 00:45, not 0:45
   
2. **VERIFY YOU'RE AT THE RIGHT SPOT**:
   - Check what happens 5 seconds before your start time
   - Confirm your start timestamp shows the FIRST action you'll describe
   - Ensure your end timestamp shows the LAST action you'll describe
   
3. **WRITE ONLY WHAT YOU SEE**:
   - Watch from start_timestamp to end_timestamp
   - Write ONLY what happens in that exact range
   - If you're tempted to write "continues from earlier" - STOP, you're misaligned

4. **MANDATORY VERIFICATION**:
   - Re-watch your exact timestamp range
   - Ask: "Does my summary describe ONLY what I see between second X and second Y?"
   - If anything in your summary happens outside those seconds, YOU HAVE FAILED

**ALIGNMENT EXAMPLES TO UNDERSTAND THE REQUIREMENT:**

‚ùå WRONG (Common 60-second error):
- Segment: start="02:00", end="02:20"
- Summary: "John walks into the room and greets everyone"
- REALITY: At 02:00, John is already mid-conversation! He entered at 01:00!

‚úÖ CORRECT:
- Segment: start="02:00", end="02:20"  
- Summary: "John discusses the quarterly results with the team, pointing at the chart"
- REALITY: This is EXACTLY what happens between 02:00-02:20

‚ùå WRONG (Temporal bleeding):
- Segment: start="03:20", end="03:40"
- Summary: "Continuing the discussion, Mary presents her analysis"
- PROBLEM: "Continuing" means the discussion started BEFORE 03:20

‚úÖ CORRECT:
- Segment: start="03:20", end="03:40"
- Summary: "Mary shows the revenue chart and explains the Q3 growth metrics"
- This describes ONLY what's visible/audible in 03:20-03:40

**TIMESTAMP VERIFICATION PROTOCOL:**
Before finalizing ANY segment, you MUST verify:
1. At [start-5]s: What's happening here should NOT be in your summary
2. At [start]s: First thing happening here MUST be first thing in your summary  
3. At [end]s: Last thing happening here MUST be last thing in your summary
4. At [end+5]s: What's happening here should NOT be in your summary

**CHARACTER ACCURACY**: 
- Include ONLY characters visible/mentioned between your exact timestamps
- Use ONLY names from the master character list provided

**SEGMENT LENGTH**: 20-30 seconds maximum (shorter is fine if natural boundary exists)

For each segment, provide the following information in JSON format:
{{
    "segments": [
        {{
            "segment_id": "unique identifier (e.g., seg_001)",
            "start_timestamp": "start time in MM:SS format (e.g., '00:45' for 45 seconds)",
            "end_timestamp": "end time in MM:SS format (e.g., '01:15' for 75 seconds)",
            "characters": ["list of main characters/people in this segment"],
            "main_plot": "MUST describe ONLY what happens between start_timestamp and end_timestamp. Any content outside this range = FAILURE",
            "boundary_verification": {{
                "before_start": "MANDATORY: What happens 1 second before start (MUST NOT appear in main_plot)",
                "at_start": "MANDATORY: First frame/sound at start timestamp (MUST be first thing in main_plot)",
                "at_end": "MANDATORY: Last frame/sound at end timestamp (MUST be last thing in main_plot)", 
                "after_end": "MANDATORY: What happens 1 second after end (MUST NOT appear in main_plot)"
            }},
            "alignment_check": {{
                "i_verified_timestamps": true,  // I watched the exact timestamp range
                "summary_matches_video": true,  // Summary describes ONLY what's in the range
                "no_content_before_start": true,  // Nothing from before start_timestamp is included
                "no_content_after_end": true  // Nothing from after end_timestamp is included
            }},
            "tension_level": "low/medium/high - based on dramatic intensity",
            "importance_score": 1-10 rating as NUMBER
        }}
    ],
    "total_segments": total number of segments as NUMBER
}}

**FINAL CRITICAL REMINDERS:**

üö® ALIGNMENT IS EVERYTHING üö®
- If your summary includes ANYTHING that happens before start_timestamp = FAIL
- If your summary includes ANYTHING that happens after end_timestamp = FAIL  
- If you're off by 60 seconds, the entire system breaks

**BEFORE SUBMITTING EACH SEGMENT:**
1. Can you swear that at second [start_timestamp], the FIRST thing in your summary is happening?
2. Can you swear that at second [end_timestamp], the LAST thing in your summary is happening?
3. Did you verify by watching ONLY the range [start_timestamp] to [end_timestamp]?

If you answered "no" to ANY of these, DO NOT SUBMIT THE SEGMENT. Re-watch and fix it.

**COMMON FAILURE PATTERNS:**
- ‚ùå Being off by exactly 60 seconds (confusing 01:30 with 00:30)
- ‚ùå Using wrong format (45 instead of "00:45")
- ‚ùå Describing the "vibe" of what happened before your segment
- ‚ùå Including context from outside your timestamp range
- ‚ùå Guessing what's happening instead of watching the exact seconds

REEL_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """You are a professional video editor specializing in creating compelling highlight reels that tell a coherent story.

Given the analyzed video segments below, select the best segments to create a highlight reel with the following constraints:
- Target duration: {target_duration} seconds (minimum: {min_duration}s, maximum: {max_duration}s)
- The reel should have a coherent narrative flow
- Prioritize high-tension moments and important plot developments
- Ensure smooth transitions between segments

Input segments:
{segments}

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
- DO NOT reference any content outside of the provided segments
- DO NOT create new plot summaries - use ONLY the exact main_plot text from input segments
- DO NOT mention or reference other movies, TV shows, or fictional content
- DO NOT create imaginary scenarios or content not present in the input
- ALL selections must be based ONLY on the segments provided above
- The segments are from a SINGLE YouTube video - maintain consistency with that video only

**TIMESTAMP ACCURACY PRESERVATION:**
- The provided segments have been CAREFULLY VERIFIED for timestamp-summary accuracy
- Each summary already matches its exact timestamp range
- ANY modification to timestamps will:
  - Break the YouTube player functionality
  - Cause summary-video misalignment
  - Create a poor user experience
- COPY all fields EXACTLY as provided - no modifications allowed

**CRITICAL TIMESTAMP PRESERVATION:**
- Copy ALL timestamps EXACTLY as they appear in the input segments
- DO NOT round, modify, or approximate any timestamp values
- Timestamps must remain as exact numeric values for YouTube player functionality
- Any timestamp modification will break the highlight player

Please select segments that create the most engaging highlight reel. Consider:
1. Narrative flow - selected segments should tell a mini-story
2. Emotional arc - build tension and release appropriately
3. Character focus - maintain consistency in featured characters when possible
4. Dramatic impact - include the most compelling moments
5. Pacing - mix high and medium tension segments for rhythm
